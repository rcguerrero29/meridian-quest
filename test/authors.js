/* NO PERSONAL ADDRESS LEAVES TOWN — not in a commit, not in a file.
   The owner, 2026-09-24: "whattt you forget about targetted phishing attacks ... i thought we had a
   cybersecurity expert in our engine... someones failing."

   What happened. Every commit carries an author name and address, and a committer, to a public server
   on every push — and none of it is in a diff, so no review, no persona and no guard ever looked. Two of
   the owner's personal addresses are on main for good: one on 17 commits Claude sessions made in the
   cloud (2026-08-30 to 2026-09-14), one on his own verdict commit from his laptop (527a35a). An address
   tied to his name, his account and a public record of which tools he uses is what a targeted phishing
   email is built from. docs/BOUNDARY.md row 13 is this edge.

   THE RULE IS AN ALLOW-LIST, CLOSED BY DEFAULT. The only addresses that may appear are no-reply ones —
   GitHub's per-account no-reply (…@users.noreply.github.com, bots included), GitHub's own
   (noreply@github.com), Claude's (noreply@anthropic.com) — and the reserved example domains (RFC 2606).
   Anything else is red, whoever wrote it. A new agent that commits under its own address stays red
   until somebody decides, here, that its address may be public.

   What it reads:
   - every commit about to ship: author, committer, and every address in the message (a
     Co-authored-by trailer is an address too);
   - every text file in the working tree, tracked or not — an uncommitted file leaks the moment it is
     pushed. No file is exempt, this one included: its fixtures build their addresses at run time.
   It never prints an address. CI logs on a public repository are public, so it names the commit, the
   field and the DOMAIN only.

   What it cannot do: take back what is already public. The range never reaches the commits above.

   Run:  node test/authors.js                   commits not yet on origin/main, and the working tree
         node test/authors.js <base> [head]     commits in base..head, and the working tree
