/* THE LOCK ON MAIN — is it still on?
   The owner, 2026-09-24: "cybersecurity should be key always."

   docs/SECURITY.md §3 step 1 — a ruleset on `main` — was written on 2026-09-21 as the first thing to do,
   and it sat undone for three days because nothing read the live setting; every document said what
   SHOULD be on. It went on that night (ruleset `main-lock`). This reads GitHub's live answer for the
   branch, so the day it is switched off or weakened, a check goes red on every push and every PR.

   Run:  node test/protect.js                  live: GET /repos/<repo>/rules/branches/main
         node test/protect.js --rules <file>   judge a saved answer instead (how a plant is run)
         node test/protect.js --selftest       the red cases, on fixtures, no network

   In CI the live read is its own workflow, `.github/workflows/protect.yml` (job `protection`): on every
   pull request, on every push to main, and ONCE A DAY — because a lock switched off on a quiet day would
   otherwise stay unnoticed until the next push, and a push through an open lock is the harm, not the
   warning. It is deliberately NOT a required check: a GitHub API hiccup must not be able to block the
   owner's merges. The self-test runs inside `smoke`, which is required, because it needs no network.

   WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, said once and plainly (Zeni's review, 2026-09-24):
   - The bypass list. It is not shown to a reader without admin rights, and the rules endpoint does
     not return it. An empty bypass list is checked by the owner in Settings → Rules, and by nothing here.
   - An edit to ITSELF. A pull request runs its own copy of this file, fixtures and all, so a PR that
     weakens judge() and deletes the matching case stays green, and after merge main runs the weak copy.
     What stands between is a person reading the diff; the rule that would make GitHub insist on it is
     "Require review from Code Owners" (docs/SECURITY.md §3 step 4), not yet switched on.
   - What the required job RUNS. It reads the first job's name in ci.yml and checks main waits for that
     name from GitHub Actions. A job of the same name that runs nothing would satisfy both GitHub and this.
   - Any branch but main. */
