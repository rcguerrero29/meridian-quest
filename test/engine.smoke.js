       `engine/shapes.js` gives a glyph the engine's own shape when the pack said nothing about that
       letter. The flat audit CANNOT check that: it only counts `THREE.Sprite`s, so a letter that
       stood as a BOX (K, S, D, T, V — 71 tiles of El Changarrito) never appeared on any row, and
       `couldBeFlat` does not even list 'fence', which is F's 93 tiles and ◺'s 9. The audit sees 37
       of the 208 tiles this change stands up. So two checks of my own, each reading its own noun:

       1 · A SHAPE STANDS WHERE THE GATE SAID IT WOULD, and it is not a box wearing the word.
           `userData.mesh` set, `userData.flat` not, and more than twelve triangles — twelve is one
           BoxGeometry, so a "shape" of twelve is the box we were trying to stop shipping.
       2 · NO SHADOW WITH NOTHING STANDING ON IT. The ground bake paints a soft radial contact pad
           under any tile that HAS a mesh view and never asks whether that tile can stand
           (`engine/engine3d.js`, grep "THE PAD"). Bind a walkable letter and its tiles get a smudge
           on the pavement with no object over it — and because it is baked into a texture, a
           scene-graph dump reports the scene identical. So this one reads PIXELS off the baked
           ground: the tile's centre against its own corner. It also proves it can SEE a pad it
           knows is there before it reports not finding one, because "nothing to measure" is a red

       which is exactly what an is-it-still-true check is for.
       AND THEN IT WENT RED ON THE TOWN, which is the more useful half. One list was shared by two
       games that lay DIFFERENT glyphs: Meridian's H is a produce crate and the town's H is a piece
       of furniture, so a letter shrinking out of one game's list silently claimed something about
       the other game's letter of the same name. That is `docs/REGRESSION.md`'s recurring shape —
       the list read the GLYPH and meant `this glyph, in this game`. It is keyed by index now, and a
       game with no row of its own gets the shared baseline. Two games diverge again tomorrow; this
       stops that from being a surprise. (docs/BEAUTIFY.md build order, item 2.) */

       is the receipt for the whole change. Until today the town had no key here, so it fell through
       to the shared FLAT_BASE of fourteen glyphs and its street was allowed to be a picture gallery:
       the audit printed 'Still flat in 3D (#39): 9×1 A×6 H×6 J×3 P×16 W×3 X×2' and called it a pass.
       `engine/shapes.js` + the gate in engine.js let the town TAKE the engine's shape for the seven
       letters it named in `SHAPETAKE` (changarrito/content/art.js), so five of those seven flat
       letters stood up. The audit said so BEFORE this row existed, red, one line per glyph, naming
       this key: that is the order it has to happen in.

       WHAT IS LEFT ON THIS ROW, and both are decisions rather than leftovers:
         'X' — the site marker, a mark on the ground and not an object.
         'H' — SIX TILES THAT COULD STAND UP TODAY AND DELIBERATELY DO NOT. The engine's `H` is an
               open produce crate; this town's `H` is a rack in a house (changarrito/content/maps.js,
               grep "racks"). Standing the engine's crate up would put six crates of tomatoes in
               the bedrooms, so the town does not name `H`. A letter on this row because somebody
               decided it belongs there is not the same as a letter nobody has got to yet, and the
               only place that difference is written down is here.

       AND THE NUMBER. This row counts SPRITES, so it can never show the biggest part of the change:
       'F' (93 tiles) and '◺' (9) stand as fence panels, which `couldBeFlat` does not list. The
       honest count of tiles that stopped being flat pictures or edge-on planes is 131:
       F 93, P 16, ◺ 9, A 6, J 3, W 3, 9 1. An earlier draft of this lane claimed 208; the other 77
       were 71 tiles of K S D T V, which are not flat — they are boxes already wearing their own
       drawings, and the gate now refuses them (`wearsArt`) — plus the 6 H tiles above. */
    /* 'J' went back on this row the same day it came off. The town took the jacaranda, and a reader
       looked at it: `wearsArt` guards a BOX's drawing, and a tree's drawing is not on a box — it is the
       sprite canopy the engine bakes by hand (engine/engine3d.js, grep "one jacaranda canopy"), which
       paints its blossoms with art("bloom") and changes them in season. engine/shapes.js's `tree` has

     is compared against px,py and handed to the bearing as tx,ty. The plan is PAPER. While there was
     one panel at 0,0 those were the same numbers, and the day a second panel exists they stop being
     the same — silently, with the street arrow pointing seventeen tiles north of where the player
     is actually being sent. Nothing about that failure is visible in a stylesheet, a log or a
     screenshot of the map; it is only visible if you ask the arrow where it is pointing.

     either game sat under a dark lid five hundredths of a tile below the floor. The stairwell's

     around. A person is stamped into the grid as `"N"`, three readers treat `"N"` as masonry, and
     when a wanderer steps into a corridor one tile wide the map really is cut in two.
     MEASURED before anything was written: of the fifteen worlds, only `ex` has chokepoints AND
     people who move — 35 tiles that cut it, four wanderers. Every other world with a chokepoint
     has nobody walking in it. So the whole of R11 lives on one street.
     Asked the only honest way: put the wanderer on EVERY tile that would cut the world, in turn,
     and ask the auditor each time. Not one sampled tile, and not a tile this test chose — the set
     is derived from the map. Red first at 35 of 35; the plant that restores the old reader still

  /* ---- THE QUEST MARKER STANDS OVER A PERSON, IT DOES NOT PAINT ON ONE ----
     docs/BEAUTIFY.md's audit: "a solid red bar through the top of the skull", on ~20 people, on the
     one object docs/STORY.md records as meaning one thing forever. Two faults in one line of code
     (`ctx.fillText("❗",x+16,y+2+bob)`, written out at four sites):
       · the baseline was the HEAD'S OWN ROW, so the mark was painted onto the person;
       · "❗" is a colour emoji, so the font paints its own palette, `fillStyle="#E0B45C"` was
         ignored, and the marker was a different drawing on every platform.
     Asked of the PICTURE, three ways, because neither fault is visible in the code:
       1. the mark adds paint ABOVE the person's own topmost row — that is what "over their head"
          means, and it is precisely what the old one did not do;
       2. the only thing it may do to the person's own pixels is DARKEN them. A thing above a head
          shades it; a bar through a skull replaces it.
     AND CHECK 2 IS THE ONE THAT WORKS, which is worth writing down rather than implying. The real
     bug was planted back in a copy outside the repo — the original fillText line, restored exactly —
     and check 1 stayed SILENT: a 13px glyph on a baseline at the head's row has an ascent that
     reaches five pixels above the person, so "does it start above them" was true of the bug. It
     went through the skull on the way DOWN. Check 2 named it: `32 of the person's own pixels are
     made lighter by the quest marker`. Check 1 is kept because it catches the other half — a mark
     drawn entirely at or below the head — but it is not the one that earned its place;
       3. in the 3D bake it is not clipped by the top of the 36×48 sprite, which is a real failure
          mode and not a hypothetical — the first version of the replacement was cut off there and

  /* ---- A TREE YOU CAN WALK UNDER HAS TO KNOW HOW TALL IT IS ----
     Owner, 2026-09-22: "can we make it tall so we can walk underneath it all ghostly?"
     There are two `t3Top`s in engine3d.js and they are not the same thing, which is how this
     survived: `m.t3Top` is a PROPERTY the merged mesh carries (its tallest vertex, set where the
     parts are baked), and `t3Top(o)` is the FUNCTION the get-out-of-the-way rule asks. The
     function reads `geometry.parameters.height` — a box has that, a sprite is handled above, and
     a merged BufferGeometry has no `parameters` at all, so every mesh tile in the game fell to
     the literal `1`. Meridian's jacaranda is 2.733 tiles tall and the rule believed it was one,
     so a tree that filled the screen from two tiles away stayed solid and the player was painted
     on top of its canopy. The check is written as the two things a person can say:
       (1) the rule's height and the thing's real height are the same number;
       (2) standing under the canopy, you can be seen THROUGH the tree.
     It reads the live scene, so what it discards is the camera and the pixels: it cannot tell you
     the glass is the right strength, only that the tree turned to glass at all. The opacity is
     judged by looking at a picture and always was. */

  /* ---- and a person behind the trolley is BEHIND it, and can still see himself ----
     The owner, 2026-09-21: "we should fix the trolley weirdness." Ridden by the line inspector (crew
     iteration 12), every position on both lines in all four cameras: the one thing a tram would never
     let you do is stand on its roof, and this one did. Then, 2026-09-22, having been shown the two
     cures and asked to pick: "for the inspector- lets make it seethrough."
     SO THIS GUARD READS TWO HALVES AND NOT ONE, and the first draft — mine, yesterday — read one.
     It asked whether the hero changed a pixel of the tram, and answered "a person standing behind a
     tram changes nothing in front of him". That sentence is only true of an OPAQUE tram. It is the
     right noun for the roof half and it is a PROXY for the whole thing the owner asked for, because
     it is equally satisfied by a car that paints him out completely — which is the state he then
     complained about. Both failures live in the same pixels and they are opposite:
       · every overlapping pixel identical to the no-hero frame  → you are invisible behind it;
       · every overlapping pixel identical to the no-tram frame  → you are painted on its roof.
     A see-through car is neither: the pixel carries some of him and some of the car, which is what
     #140 means by "the pixel holds both of them and the position is honest either way".
     Asked as pixels, four frames: the hero's footprint (him on, him off, no tram), the tram's
     footprint (tram on, tram off, no hero), and inside where they overlap, how many pixels moved
     when each of the two was taken away. Raw renders after one draw3d, because draw3d re-places the
     tram each frame and would undo the toggles. */

       "How much of him survives" was first asked over the OVERLAP, and the overlap is itself a
       function of how see-through the car is — so the ladder came back 3%, 0%, 0%, 0%, 1%, 31% and
       was not measuring anything monotonic. His own silhouette does not move when the glass changes.

     and in iso a person standing in front of the car was painted under it and one behind it had his
     legs cut off at its roof line — the other two readings of "laying on the trolley". A car is a
     thing on its row, and the depth queue every camera already keeps is where it belongs: whoever
     is nearer the camera than the rails paints over it, whoever is farther paints under it.
     Asked as pixels in each flat camera, with the car alongside the hero's column: a person on the
     row in FRONT of the rails keeps every pixel of himself (the car changes none), and a person on
     the row BEHIND the rails yields every pixel where they overlap (he changes none of the car).

     inspector, crew iteration 12): 42 pixels of string inside the hero's own outline, none of them a
     flag. The bridge's string over the crossing does the same to whoever crosses under it.
     Asked as pixels, the way he saw it (docs/POSTMORTEM.md §3): the hero's footprint is the frame with
     him minus the frame without him; the string's reach into it is the frame with the strings minus the
     frame without them, inside that footprint — at both quarter turns. And at the two stops that look

  /* ---- AN OFRENDA STANDS ON SOMETHING (crew iteration 14, la ofrendera) ----
     The owner, 2026-09-22: "the altar above the table at dona tenchas is not ok, please fix." It was
     0.29 of a tile up in the air over her table, and the cause is a proxy of the oldest kind: the
     season-prop pass asked `wallH(g)` — 0.55 + the glyph's declared `lift` × 0.042, which is the
     height of a BOX — for a tile whose shape is a MESH. `wallH("T")` is 0.802; the table's own parts
     stop at 0.550. The number that is right for a box is exactly the one that is wrong for a mesh,
     which is why this asks BOTH: Meridian's table is a mesh, El Changarrito's is still a box.
     WHAT IT READS, and it is two things measured out of the BUILT SCENE and nothing out of the
     engine's arithmetic (docs/POSTMORTEM.md §0, .claude/skills/guard/SKILL.md §1):
       · where the prop was set down — the object's own y in the 3D group;
       · the top of what it was set ON — the highest vertex of the geometry already standing on that
         same tile, from its bounding box. A billboard is a picture and has no top, so only real
         geometry counts.
     TOLERANCE 0.05 of a tile, and the reason is the screen: the 3D camera stands 7.4 tiles back and
     6.2 up, a tile is about 35 px on a phone, so one screen pixel is 0.029 of a tile. 0.05 is under
     two pixels — the smallest disagreement anybody could see — while the fault it was written for is
     0.262, which is nine. Inside it sit the engine's own 0.01 of clearance and the 0.008 by which a
     box's measured height differs from the `wallH` formula.
     WHAT IT DOES NOT READ: a prop whose own art floats inside its own model. This says where the
     thing was set down, not where its ink starts.
     A prop the pack hangs in a window (`sill`) is not standing on the tile and is not asked. */

     A portal used to swap the world between one frame and the next and then block input for 450ms
     with nothing drawn in it — an instant cut, then standing still somewhere you did not walk to.
     The transition slot existed and was empty.

     The noun is "you never see one place become another", and there are exactly two ways to fail it:
       1. the swap happens while the overlay is not covering the screen — a visible cut;
       2. the overlay covers and never comes back up — a game that goes black and stays black.
     Both are asked of the DOM, at the moment it matters, by driving the real portal and watching the
     leaves' own geometry rather than a class name: a class is a label, a rectangle is the thing the
     player sees. And the door is taken from the SHELL, so a second world that forgot to put the
     element in its own index.html fails here rather than teleporting silently.
     IT SITS HERE, AHEAD OF THE DOCUMENT CHECKS, because those do `body.innerHTML = ''` and never put
     it back — so every later check that needs a real screen is measuring a page with no viewport in
     it. This one said so out loud rather than passing quietly, which is how it was found. */

  /* ---- EVERY PLACE IS ON THE MAP, AND THE MAP AGREES WITH THE DOORS ----
     Owner, 2026-09-17, asked whether an interior belongs on a street map at all: "yeah i mean a map
     implies this lol". He is right, and the city was not keeping that promise — six of fifteen
     worlds were on the plan in NO form, including the park, which is the third-largest world in the
     game. Seven more had a hand-typed dot, and every one of those seven agreed exactly with the
     door that leads there: seven copies of a fact the map already had.

     Two claims:
       1. every world can be LOCATED on the plan — drawn, or reached from somewhere that is, or
          declared by the pack because nothing leads there (the park, reached on a leash);
       2. and a DECLARED spot agrees with the doors. This is the one worth having: a copy's failure
          mode is that the door moves and the copy does not, and nothing on screen looks wrong —
          the mark simply points at the wrong building, forever, and no camera can tell you.
     A world that a pack deliberately keeps off the map is a real thing (a memory, a dream, a menu),

     before it all argued about how big the sugar skull should be. Rendered at 8x before touching
     anything, the cause was plain: `TILES.win` is a rect the sill props, the dusk lighting and the
     candy's ledge are ALL positioned from, and nothing had ever drawn it. The plain facade painted
     two flat rectangles a shade off the wall; the mural panel then painted plaster over the whole
     tile and erased even those. So a lit pane, a sweet and a stone ledge sat in the middle of a
     blank wall. Every one of them was in the right place. There was just no window.

     The noun is "a window you can see, with a ledge under it", and it is asked of the PICTURE,
     because none of this is visible in the code:
       1. for every window the wall SHOWS (winsKept — a mural may paint one out, and then it must
          be gone from the picture too), the glass has to separate from the wall beside it by the
          repo's own floor of 40 luma. A window painted over is a window that fails this;
       2. under it, a LEDGE: the row at the window's foot is bright and the row under that is dark.
          A hard light-over-dark horizontal edge is the one shape that survives being scaled to
          three screen pixels, which is why the four size fixes never worked and this does;
       3. and every sill prop the season sets down stands in a window that passed 1 and 2.
     Check 3 is the one that would have caught the owner's tile: the candy at st(22,0) resolved to
     a window the mural had plastered over, and checks 1 and 2 are run on the tile AS THE GAME
     PAINTS IT — the facade art and then whatever decor is painted on top of it.
     PLANTED, both of them, in a copy outside the repo with the real code restored exactly:
       · the flat-rectangle window back in TILEDRAW["B"] → `the window at 5,10,8,9 is 0 luma from
         its lightest pixel to its darkest` and `no ledge under the window at 5,10,8,9`;
       · the panel plastering the whole tile again → the same two, at st 21,0 through 27,0, which
         is the owner's sentence in numbers.
     The first draft of check 1 measured something else — the mean of one row through the window
     against the wall beside it — and EL CHANGARRITO FAILED IT WHILE DRAWING A GOOD WINDOW, because
     that row crossed the shop's dark sign. It is written up where it happened, in `judge`. */

  /* ---- A FLIGHT IS WALKED, NOT TELEPORTED (owner, 2026-09-17: "ok lets do b") ----
     What he reported: "that door right there to the top of a staircase. until you figure out how
     to teleport in my side of the screen." The code agreed with him in its own comment — the
     avenue door put you on the LANDING of Nolasco's stairs, at the top, with the whole climb
     behind you and none of it walked.

     Two nouns, and the second is the one that was quietly broken everywhere:
       1. NO PORTAL PUTS YOU AT THE SHALLOW END OF A FLIGHT. If a portal's arrival tile sits on a
          well run, it has to be the deepest tread of that run — the foot. Arriving at the head
          means the climb happened off-screen, which is the thing he refused.
       2. WHOEVER STANDS IN A WELL IS DRAWN IN IT. `stairLift`/`wellDepth` existed for two
          versions and ONLY engine3d.js ever read them, so in top, front and iso the hole was
          painted as ordinary floor and the hero stood on top of it at full height. Asked of the
          drawing, not the code: `drawPerson` is stubbed, each camera is rendered with the hero on
          each tread in turn, and the y it is called with has to descend as the treads do.
          Both flat cameras centre on the hero, so that y moves for exactly one reason — the drop.
     Run for every world, so a second game that digs a well gets the same two promises. */

       THROUGH IT, because the landing is not ON the run, it is the tile past the end of it. The
       hole was the whole bug.
       The rule that catches it also has to let hq↔f2 through, and for the right reason rather than
       by luck: there you leave standing ON a flight (the ▲ head) and arrive at the head of the
       well on the other side, and the two halves add up to one storey across the landing. What

       a guard that says "I measured nothing" is still a guard that measured nothing, and next week
