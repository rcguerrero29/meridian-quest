/* EL HORNO — one room, one tray, one verb, run against the shared suite AND actually played.

   Owner, 2026-09-22: "why no for the game? because we havent built it? we will soon."

   Same construction as test/gauge.js and for the same reason: the shell is GENERATED from the
   public index rather than copied, because ~770 of its ~800 lines must be identical (the shared
   suite reads about twenty element ids straight out of it) and a copy would rot silently the
   first time index.html changed. Every edit below asserts it actually matched — a String.replace
   that stops matching returns the input unchanged and would otherwise print success while
   testing the wrong thing.

   UNPUBLISHED, ON PURPOSE. content/horno/ is NOT in scripts/build-site.sh's allowlist and is not
   linked from anything. Publishing it is the owner's call, not a session's.

/* ───────────────── 2 · THE VERB, PLAYED ─────────────────

   THE CHECK THIS PACK EXISTS FOR, and it reads PIXELS because that is the noun.

   The thing being claimed is not "propSet works". It is the owner's sentence: you press one
   button and the SAME OBJECT changes in all four cameras. A guard that called hBake() would be
   testing the function and not the feature (docs/POSTMORTEM.md §4), and a guard that asserted
   "the glyph is now v" would be reading the fix rather than the shape a player sees (§13k). So
   this walks to the tray, presses the Read button a person presses, presses the button on the
   sheet a person presses, and then counts the pixels that moved in each camera.

   THE CONTROL RUNS FIRST AND MUST BE ZERO (§13r). Shoot the same frame twice with nothing
   pressed; if that is not zero the probe measures the animation and every number after it is
   worthless. The clocks are pinned for exactly that reason (REGRESSION row C).

   AND IT WENT RED ON THE CODE IT WAS WRITTEN AGAINST. The first run of this check reported
   `the isometric camera drew the same frame after the bake as before it: 0 pixels moved` —
   because drawIso paints every SOLID glyph as a coloured slab and never asks the tile's painter
   (engine.js, grep `isoBlock(cx,cy,ISOCOL`), and the `iso` slot the view registry advertises at
   engine.js (grep `TILEART["J"] = { top`) advertises an `iso` slot that is WRITE-ONLY: nothing in engine/ ever calls tileView(g,"iso"). MAPCOL is the
   only seam a pack has there. This is the guard that found it and it is the guard that holds it.

   ALL FOUR CAMERAS ARE READ AS PIXELS, INCLUDING THE 3D ONE, and the first draft of this file did
   not do that. It asked the baked scene what glyph the mesh at the tray's tile was LABELLED with
   (`m.userData.g`) — which is a proxy for the noun and not the noun (docs/REGRESSION.md's proxy
   register). A reader planted `mesh:hTrayMesh("p")` on all three tray states, so the 3D tray never
   changed shape at all, and this file printed `the mesh standing at the tray is now a "v"` and
   exited 0. It was the ONLY camera never pixel-diffed, and it is the camera content/horno/config.js
   names as the one the pack is FOR (CAMDEF="3d"). The WebGL buffer is not kept after compositing,
   so it is rendered on demand and copied into a 2D canvas in the same task — `T3.renderer.render`,
   then drawImage, then getImageData. The label check is kept as well, because it says one thing
   pixels cannot: WHICH glyph the scene is holding. It is no longer the only thing asked.

   WHAT THE COUNT DISCARDS, in the same breath: a whole-canvas pixel count cannot say the TRAY
   changed, only that the frame did, and it cannot tell a new SHAPE from a recolour — which is
   exactly how the iso camera passes. That is why the control is zero, why the changed box is
   printed beside the count so a person reading a failure can see where the pixels were, and why
   the pass sentence at the foot of this file says "shape" for three cameras and "colour" for the
   fourth instead of claiming all four alike. */

    /* ───────── 2b · THE ROOM, MEASURED AGAINST THE PERSON WHO WORKS IN IT ─────────

       WHY THIS EXISTS. A previous pass raised this bench from 0.502 to 0.696 world units on a
       measurement of the wrong thing — it sized the furniture against the top edge of a person's
       sprite CARD (1.265) instead of against the person, and the card is 8px of speech-bubble
       headroom taller than she is. The bench top ended up above her shoulder, the dough level with
       her face, and the pan cut the sign on the wall behind it in half. EVERY SUITE WAS GREEN, both
       before and after, and the 3D pixel diff above was 76 either way, because a diff asks whether
       the frame CHANGED and never whether the room makes sense. If proportion matters here, then
       something has to read it, and this is the something.

       IT DOES NOT TRUST ANY NUMBER IN ANY COMMENT, INCLUDING THIS FILE'S.
       - The PERSON is PAINTED and then SCANNED: drawPerson into a 36x48 card through the same
         transform engine3d.js hands every artist, then the topmost opaque row. Her feet are the
         sprite's own `center.y` and her card is the sprite's own `scale.y`, both read off the live
         billboard. So this tracks T3PERSON through any rescale — the cast went 1.12 -> 0.92 on
         2026-09-22 — without anybody remembering to update a constant here. A guard that names its
         own copy of a number is testing its own arithmetic (.claude/skills/guard/SKILL.md).
       - The PROP is the engine's own `t3Top` off the baked mesh — "the tallest ink in the thing
         itself" (engine3d.js, grep `m.t3Top=`) — not a sum this file computes from the parts.

       WHAT THE EXTRACTION THREW AWAY, in the same breath as the result: two scalars. A height and a
       height. This cannot see WIDTH, so a bench the right height and three tiles wide passes; it
       cannot see what the bench is BEHIND, so it would not have caught the sign on its own; and it
       cannot see the flat cameras at all, where a tile's height on screen comes from its row.

       THE BAND, and it is about THIS drawing and not about people. She is a cartoon with a large
       head, so human proportions do not transfer. Off drawPerson's own coordinates, as fractions of
       her drawn height: feet 0.09, hip 0.31, shoulder 0.66, the middle of her head 0.78, the top of
       her head 1.00. A bench you get your weight over stands between the hip and the chin, and what

       THIS CHECK EXISTS BECAUSE A PLANT WALKED STRAIGHT PAST EVERYTHING BELOW IT. On 2026-09-23 the
       dough bench was deleted from the map — `"w.m.p...w"` back to `"w...p...w"` — and `test/horno.js`
       came back GREEN and printed its whole pass sentence, the one that says you walk to the other

       this one printed a lie.

       WHY IT GOT THROUGH, and it is worth stating plainly because every pack inherits it: READS
       declares a COORDINATE, and readAt (engine.js, grep `const readAt=`) matches on world/x/y and
       whether the document exists. It never asks what is STANDING there. So the read mark floats over
       bare floor, the Read button lights, the card opens — and the knead's own state lives in the
       pack (H_MASA) and reaches the tray through hRise/hSpread, neither of which is a tile. Every
       assertion below was about the dough's BEHAVIOUR and not one was about the dough's PRESENCE, so
       deleting the object changed nothing any of them could see.

       The engine's own rule, printed beside readAt: "a thing you can read is a place." This is that

    /* ───────── 2c½ · THE KNEAD. A STROKE, AND WHERE THE STROKE WENT ─────────

       This is the second verb and it is the one that could not be checked by asking whether a frame
       changed, because its whole content is WHICH PART of a surface your hand has been over. So it is
       checked in two different currencies and they are kept apart on purpose:

       - THE FIELD, exactly. H_MASA.cover is arithmetic; a claim about it can be proved and not
         estimated. That is where "the dough develops where your hand went" is tested, by working one
         third of the lump with a real drag and requiring the far third to be UNTOUCHED — zero, not
         small. A per-region claim tested with a whole-object average is exactly the proxy this repo
         keeps a register of (docs/REGRESSION.md).
       - THE PIXELS, for the two things the field cannot say: that the drawing actually repainted, and
         that a worked dough reaches the three rounds on the TRAY in 3D — which is the only reason the
         gesture is worth a player's attention a second time.

       WHAT THE EXTRACTIONS THREW AWAY, said out loud: the field check discards how it LOOKS (a dough
       whose numbers are perfect and whose drawing is a grey disc would pass it), and the pixel checks
       discard what the pixels ARE (they say something changed at the tray, never that it is bread).
       Neither is the other's evidence, which is why both are here.

       AND THE CLOCKS COME BACK FOR THE WALK. Pinning performance.now freezes movement, so the walk to
       the second bench restores the real pair stashed at pin time and re-pins on arrival — the four
       pixel diffs above are already taken, so nothing upstream can be disturbed by it. */

       own dough and the camera and hid it completely in 3D — the wall the walk leaned on disappeared,
       and the walk sailed past to (2,4), where `up` is the dough itself and solid, so the player stood
