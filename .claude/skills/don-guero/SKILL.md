# Don Güero, city planner

The city grows in phases. Planning happens in **Don Güero's head (an Opus 5 agent)**;
decisions come back to the owner as **side quests**; the main session builds only
after the permits are signed. Fun is a requirement, not a nice-to-have.

## The loop

0. **Read `docs/OWNER.md` first** — the owner's standing rules. Never put a
   **Settled** item to them again.
1. **Read the ledger**: `docs/CITY.md` (create it from the template there if
   missing — it should already exist). Note any decisions still marked ⏳ pending.

2. **Summon the planner**: spawn the `don-guero` agent (Agent tool,
   `subagent_type: "don-guero"` — its definition pins Opus 5; don't override the
   model). Prompt it with: the current phase number, any newly signed decisions
   since the last plan, and what the owner asked for this session. It returns the
   growth plan, side quests, and ledger updates.

3. **Run the side quests**: present Don Güero's open decisions to the owner via
   `AskUserQuestion` — one call, up to 4 questions. Keep his framing: header like
   "❗ Obra" / "❗ Permiso", his voice in the question text, his options with their
   one-line consequences. The owner picking an answer IS the quest reward — respond
   in character (one line, e.g. "Don Güero stamps the permit. The crew starts
   Monday.") before moving on.

4. **Sign the ledger**: append the answered decisions to `docs/CITY.md`'s decision
   log (date + quest + choice + one-line why), apply the planner's ledger updates,
   and update the phase number. Commit with the rest of the session's work.

5. **Build (same or next session)**: the plan's build notes are the work order —
   new content in `content/meridian/` (or a new pack), map edits, NPCs, quests.
   Normal shipping rules apply (`docs/HANDOFF.md`): smoke test green, EN/ES in
   lockstep, bump `sw.js` CACHE, playtest stop added if the feature is visible.

## House rules

- Don Güero plans, the session builds, the owner decides. Never skip step 3 on a
  real tradeoff — the owner WANTS the side quests.
- Every new business: Hispanic-owned, and a practice pack for an AI role the owner
  wants to be hired in (the ledger's "Purpose" section lists the roles).
- One phase at a time. Don't bank unbuilt phases; the ledger's ⏳ items come first.
- If tokens are short: run steps 1-4 only and record the plan — building can wait,
  a signed ledger cannot.

## Honesty & the approval ladder

- **If the planner agent fails to run** (rate limit, error, anything), say so in the
  FIRST line of your reply and label any plan you write as your own, in their voice —
  never as theirs. This went wrong twice on 2026-08-31.
- **Stay in your lane.** Don Güero plans parcels, businesses and AI-role packs; Nacho
  plans story, arcs and endings. The session builds. Neither plans the other's craft.
- **Signed ≠ built.** Where the ledger records a rule the code has not implemented,
  say so every place it is written.
- **After every signing**, ask whether the answer outlives this phase. If it does and
  it fits in one sentence that a planner could apply to a business nobody has invented
  yet, add it to `docs/OWNER.md` under Settled or Taste. That is how the owner
  graduates from refereeing every call to browsing and approving.
