name: guard
description: The pre-flight for writing or trusting a guard — a test, a check, a scan, a CI step. Use when the user says /guard, before writing any new test or assertion, at step 5 of /crew-fix, whenever a suite is green and somebody is surprised, and whenever a guard is about to be believed. Carries the four ways a guard fools the person who wrote it, each with the run that found it. Reading a guard is not checking it; planting is.

# Guard — the pre-flight, and the four ways a guard fools its author

*Opened 2026-09-15, after four guards written in one day each went green while wrong — and each was
caught by a plant or by looking, never by reading. This file exists because the lesson had already
been written down twice that week, in `docs/REGRESSION.md` and in the guards' own comments, and a
rule in a document has never stopped anything. Pili painted that on the wall the same afternoon:
**the lamp is the instrument; the sentence in the file is not.***

`docs/REGRESSION.md` holds the register of guards that read a **proxy** — asked one thing and meant
another. That is the biggest family and it has twenty-five rows. This file is the other half: four
ways a guard is asking the right question and still cannot answer it.

## Before you write the assertion

**1 · Say out loud what a person would notice if this broke.** Write the failure message first, in
that sentence. If the message needs a variable name in it to make sense, the guard is reading the
code and not the thing.

**2 · Decide what you will plant.** A guard you cannot describe a plant for is a guard you cannot
check. Plant in a copy **outside the repository**, and prove the working tree is clean afterwards.

**3 · Then write it, and run the plant.** Green before the plant and red after, in the sentence from
step 1. Anything else and you have not finished.

## The four ways it fools you

### 1 · It supplies its own inputs

*The quest-marker guard baked the 3D sprite with a lift and a scale it had **typed out itself**.
`engine3d.js` passed its own literals. Changing the numbers the engine actually ships walked
straight past the check, silently — the guard was testing its own arithmetic.*

**Ask:** where did every input come from? If the guard names a constant the code also names
separately, there is no guard — there are two copies of a number. Move the value to **one** place the
code reads at runtime and have the guard read the same one. Best: give the call site a *name*
(`drawSayMark(g,x,y,"bake")`) so there are no numbers at the call site to drift.

### 2 · It has nothing to measure, and passes anyway

*The bearing guard reported `Infinity%` for three directions and said nothing at all about the
fourth. The viewport was `0×0` behind the character panel, `0/0` is `NaN`, and every comparison
against `NaN` is false. **The one direction that looked fine was the one dividing nothing by
nothing.***

**Ask:** what does this guard do when the thing it measures is absent, empty, hidden or zero-sized?
Assert the *preconditions* out loud and fail on them. Nothing to look at is **not** a pass — that is
`docs/GAUGE.md`'s silent zero, and it is the most common way a check evaporates.

### 3 · It reads the clock

*The marker guard went green, then red on the next run with "3 pixels". The marker rides a sine of
`Date.now()`. One sample tests one phase of an animation and calls it the drawing.*

**Ask:** is anything here a function of time, of `Math.random`, of a date, of the device, of the
order tests ran in? Stub it and sweep the whole range — eight phases of a full period, not one. A
guard that passes or fails by the clock is worth **less than no guard**, because it teaches people
to re-run it until it is green.

### 4 · It measures the surface it was given, not the one that ships

*The first clip test asked "does the mark touch row 0 of the sprite?" — but the top row is there to
be used, so it failed good art and would have passed a mark that wanted to paint five rows higher.
Drawing the same mark onto a surface with forty extra rows of sky and counting what lands above the
real top reads the actual noun: **what does the bake throw away.***

**Ask:** am I measuring the thing, or the edge of the container I happened to put it in? Where a
limit is the subject, give yourself room beyond the limit and measure what falls outside it.

---

## And one that is not about guards at all

**A background job that never returns never reports.** Two jobs in one day ran for five and nine
hours having finished their work in seconds: a multi-line command was flattened to one line, so a
heredoc never terminated and `python3` / `node -c` sat reading stdin forever. Both looked like work
in progress and were not.

**Write the script to a file, then run the file.** Never put a heredoc, or any command whose meaning
depends on its newlines, into a background shell. And when a background job has been running far
longer than its work could take, `ps -eo pid,etime,cmd` first — the answer is usually that it is
waiting for input nobody is going to give it.

## The one line under all of it

Reading a guard tells you what its author meant. Only a plant tells you what it does.
