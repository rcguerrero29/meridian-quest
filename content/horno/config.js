/* EL HORNO — one room, one bench, one tray. A choice, and a rhythm.
   Owner, 2026-09-22: "theoretically can we use these polygonal art for the cooking game? we can
   try to surprise AJ with a baking option lol" and, when a producer said no to the game half,
   "why no for the game? because we havent built it? we will soon".

   This is the smallest thing that is genuinely a baking THING YOU DO. It is its own pack — its
   own shell, its own prefix, its own storage — exactly the way content/gauge/ is, so it costs
   Meridian nothing and edits none of its files. docs/story/el-changarrito.md §7½ governs a second
   world: it trains no role, carries no curriculum, is never a district of Meridian and never a
   chapter in its story. Nothing here reaches into content/meridian/ at runtime.

   TWO VERBS NOW, and the second one owes everything to the first one not needing it. The tray is
   full, readable and bakeable from the first second — walk three tiles, press Read, press a shell.
   Kneading is the other bench and it gates NOTHING: no step of the bake waits on it, it cannot be
   failed, and it can be left in one press. An action you could skip in a tap and do not is the
   definition of something done on purpose; an action you must finish is a toll. Owner, 2026-09-22,
   correcting this session, which had priced it as a wait needing a clock: "i know the time seems
   strange but kneading could be therapeutic." A wait is time you spend to be allowed something.
   A rhythm advances per gesture, with no clock anywhere — which is the only shape this pack could
   take, because it refuses a timer three lines below. See content/horno/docs.js, the `masa` card.

   THREE THINGS IT REFUSES BY CONSTRUCTION, and the refusal is the design:
     THE ADDRESSES ARE GREPS AND NOT LINE NUMBERS, and that is not a style choice: this file
     shipped on 2026-09-22 citing :143, :152-155 and :156-159, and by the end of the SAME DAY all
     three were about a hundred lines out, because a sibling lane rewrote that document's shape
     section and everything below it moved. Line 143 now lands in the middle of SHAPETAKE. The
     rules quoted below were correct; only the addresses rotted. Grep the sentence.
     - no inventory. Nothing is carried, counted or held. docs/NEW-WORLD.md prices it, grep
       `an inventory this engine does not have`.
     - no timer, no day budget. docs/NEW-WORLD.md, grep `nothing in it spends a day`: the engine
       reads the real clock for light only. The verb here is a CHOICE, not a wait.
     - no punishment. docs/NEW-WORLD.md, grep `punishment if it SUBTRACTS` (the phrase wraps a line, so grep the tail).
       You may change your mind about the shell colour for ever and lose nothing. */
