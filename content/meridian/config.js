   with cempasúchil instead of bands), `papel` (a palette hangs papel picado over the
   crossing in 3D), `sky` (the north window's dusk). `papelBridge` (the cut hung over the
   crossing, marigold so the bridge reads as one warm object). Palette SIGNED 2026-09-07 ("marigold"), re-cut the
   same evening on Pili's read — a real value range, embers to pale gold, dark first, so the heap has depth:
   a cempasúchil gradient, gold to deep orange, after the marigold bridge of Día de Muertos —
