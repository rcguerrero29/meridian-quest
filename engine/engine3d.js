     The owner, 2026-09-22, choosing between two cures for a person who disappears at his own stop:
     "for the inspector- lets make it seethrough". Yesterday the cure was DEPTH — the car hid your
     legs, honestly, the way a tram does — and honest is not the same as usable: at the stop, in the
     camera both games boot into, the car covered him to the shoulders and at the corner stop it
     covered all of him. So the car takes the treatment #140 already gives a tree: it stays exactly
     where it is, at T3GHOST, drawn AFTER the people and writing no depth, so the pixel holds both
     of them and "he is behind it" is still the honest reading. A tram is the one object in this
     game for which that is not even a convention — it is glazed on four sides, and a person behind
     a real one IS half visible through the windows.
     Materials are shared between the cars (one wheel material, one glazing material, and the pack's
     body is cloned), so the glass copy is made once per PIECE and kept beside the solid one, never
     edited in place — one ghosted wheel would otherwise fog the whole train. t3Reveal does the same

   The owner, 2026-09-22: "you can make my character smaller as i mentioned before for the cool looks."
   Every actor rides a 36x48 card and this is what that card is worth in tiles: the sprite's anchor is
   a FRACTION of the card (`center.set(0.5,4/48)`, his feet), so changing this scales him about his own
   shoes and nothing floats. A person's drawn height is about 32 of the 48 rows, so his height in tiles
   is very nearly this number itself — which is how the size can be argued instead of felt:
     · a DOORWAY in this engine is 1.0 (engine3d.js, the door slab is BoxGeometry(1,1,0.14) at y=0.5);
     · a real person is about 1.70 m and a real doorway about 2.05 m, so a person is 0.83 of a door;
     · at 1.12 the cast was 1.12 of a door — every one of the thirty-six walked under a lintel shorter
       than they are, which is the sort of thing you stop seeing after a week and cannot unsee after.
   The FLOOR, the thing that does not compress: a tile is about 35 px on a phone, so at 1.12 a person
   is 39 px and his face is two of them. Take too much off and the barrio is thirty-six silhouettes —
   and Pili measured on 2026-09-22 that twenty-six of the thirty-six already share one of two outlines,
   so the face is not spare capacity. The ladder 1.12 / 1.00 / 0.92 / 0.84 was rendered at phone width,
   on the street and in HQ, and the frame chose 0.92 — an 18% cut:
     1.12  his head crosses the shop windows' band on Calle Principal, and four people fill an office;
     1.00  exactly a doorway, which is the size of the LINTEL and not of a person;
     0.92  under the lintel, clear of the window band, the face still two eyes and a mouth at 32 px;
     0.84  the arithmetic's own answer, and the floor bites: he is level with a DESK PLANT in HQ, and
           a person the same height as the thing on the desk is a ruler that has stopped ruling.
   So the honest ratio is 0.84 and the shipped number is 0.92, and the reason is legibility, not taste.
   EVERY BODY, not only the hero (the owner said "my character"): thirty-six people walk under the
   same lintels, and shrinking one of them makes him a child standing next to the tamalera rather than
   making the street bigger. The size of a person is the size of the world.
   A `let`, not a `const`, for one reason: the ladder is rendered by sweeping THIS value, and the guard
   reads THIS value. A guard that names its own copy of a number is testing its own arithmetic
   (.claude/skills/guard/SKILL.md, the first of the four).
   T3SIGN is the quest mark and the read mark, which ride the same pool and are NOT people. A mark is
   signage: it is sized to be read at arm's length across a street, and it does not shrink because the
   cast did. Rigo's rule for the one painted thing on a tram that is still not livery — "the signal
   lamp... is the only sentence the vehicle can say, and it is not on anybody's menu" — is the same
   rule, and the marks are this game's signal lamp. */

   T3GHOST is a TREE's number: a ghosted crown has to still read as a tree, and what stands behind a
   tree is a whole person-sized silhouette. A ghosted TRAM has a person behind it, 39 px tall, most of
   him dark clothes against a dark road — and at 0.68 the four-frame probe found 3% of the pixels
   where he and the car meet carrying any of him at all: his face, and nothing else. "See-through" was
   true of the material and false of the picture, which is docs/REGRESSION.md's whole subject.
   Swept 0.68 / 0.60 / 0.52 / 0.45 / 0.38 / 0.30 and looked at every frame (crew iteration 14). A

   A wall is a plane you are meant to see over: dropping it to a knee-high stub in its own top colour
   reads as a cutaway, which is what every third-person camera does, and it is what the owner already
   signed off on in #65. A tree, a lamp, a piñata is an OBJECT: half a tree is not a cutaway, it is a
   missing tree, and the room stops making sense. So a tall object turns to GLASS instead — still
   there, still in its place, drawn at T3GHOST so you can be seen through it.
   The glass is drawn AFTER the people and writes no depth, which is why the hero can keep drawing
   through walls (#22, #92) and still read as being BEHIND the tree: the crown is painted over him at
   55%, so the pixel holds both of them and the position is honest either way.
   Materials can be shared between pieces of one glyph, so the glass copy is made once per PIECE and
   kept beside the solid one — never edited in place, or one tree would fog the whole row. */
